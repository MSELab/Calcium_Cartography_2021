# [MSE Lab](https://github.com/MSELab) calcium cartography Python code

This is a repository for the associated Python code for the manuscript titled: From spikes to intercellular waves: tuning intercellular Ca2+ signaling dynamics modulates organ size control. The code was built by [Dr. Ramezan Paravi Torghabeh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramezan-paravi-torghabeh-phd-b432baa0/). The code was then later updated and adapted for creation of the figures in the manuscript by [Francisco Huizar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-huizar-82bb1a127/). Experimental work and validation was led by [Dharsan Soundarrajan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AWv4OiIAAAAJ&hl=en). This work was done within the [Multicellular Systems Engineering Lab](http://sites.nd.edu/zartmanlab/) at the University of Notre Dame. Please direct any questions to the lab principal investigator, [Dr. Jeremiah Zartman](http://sites.nd.edu/zartmanlab/contacts/). 

All code was done using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks where all code was run and the visible outputs are saved in the iPython notebooks. The code is available to be downloaded and run after installation of the latest version of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Each notebook is labeled corresponding to its associated figure in the main text of the manuscript. The 'stochastic' and 'geometry' folders are required to run the code. All simulation outputs were coded to be saved in the 'simulationResults' folder, and are labeled according to figure numbers. Use of [Epitools](https://epitools.ausvet.com.au/) was done to create a 2-D geometrically accurate representation of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. The corresponding folder for this is in the 'epitools (Figure S1 Creation)' folder.

[Here](https://github.com/MSELab/) is a link to the main folder containing the code.
